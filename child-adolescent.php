                                                A traumatic event is one that threatens injury, death, or the physical integrity of self or others and also causes horror, terror, or helplessness at the time it occurs. Traumatic events include sexual abuse, physical abuse, domestic violence, community and school violence, medical trauma, motor vehicle accidents, acts of terrorism, war experiences, natural and human-made disasters, suicides, and other traumatic losses. Cognitive behavior therapy and other trauma-focused techniques can help children with cognitive distortions related to the trauma, such as self-blame, develop more adaptive understanding and perceptions of the trauma.

                                    <p class="font-weight-light m-0">An eating disorder is a mental health condition where you use the control of food to cope with feelings and other situations. Unhealthy eating behaviours include eating too much or too little or worrying about your weight or body shape. While anybody can get an eating disorder, it is usually common in teenagers between 13 and 17 years. With the popularization of unhealthy and unachievable body types through social media,teenagers often develop eating disorders and body dysmorphia. At Solace, we work towards helping our clients to develop a healthy relationship with food and their body.</p>

Teenagers at this time also struggle for independence and control, develop romantic interest and feelings, and are easily influenced by their peers and the need to be accepted by their social group. These changes can often lead to conflicts at home, in school and with other authority figures. In this age of social media, we aim to help struggling teenagers to gain clarity regarding their development and how to perceive and face these challenges in a healthy way.</p>
